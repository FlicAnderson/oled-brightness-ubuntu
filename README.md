Modified from the original https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_15_7590 to work
with Ubuntu and any locale

Further modified to work on my Ubuntu 18.04 Dell XPS 15 7590, with intel drivers fix. 
Previous version didn't work, as it operated on 'eDP-1' rather than 'eDP1' the display my system was looking for.
